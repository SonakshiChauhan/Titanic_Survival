# Titanic_Survival

**Completed by Sonakshi Chauhan.**

**Overview:** This project is using the Titanic Dataset to create a model that will 
-return a conditional survival probabily of a passenger 
-Help you comapre and contrast all the Classification models based on accuracy
-data vizualizations given a condition on a numerical variable from the dataset. 

**Problem Statement:** Build a model that will return a passengers survival chance given a passengers detail as input. 

**Data:** [Titanic Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

**Deliverables:** Probability
**Ahoy! Let's Sail**
